# Webpack test

Basic setup to get started with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [react hot loader](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/), and [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/).
Yes, I know that **react hot loader** is being deprecated in favour of [React Transform](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate), but for now be happy with the old version :sparkling_heart:

## Getting started

Clone the repo

`$ git clone git@github.com:vrde/webpack-test.git`


Install dependencies

`$ npm i`


Run the dev server

`$ webpack-dev-server --hot --inline`


Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/).
